Probuilder is a visual live CSS editor that helps you change the design of your website with ease.

== Description ==

Probuilder is a visual live CSS editor that helps you adapt the design of your website in a super simple way. Just activate Probuilder in the front end, select an element on your site and click on it. An editor with lots of different properties will open. All you need to do now is select or enter the values you would like to apply. Probuilder is both for experienced users as well as people without any coding knowledge. Even if you have no idea about CSS you will be able to adapt your website's design using Probuilder.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/probuilder` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to the front end of your website and click on the blue button in the top right corner saying 'Activate Probuilder'.
4. Once activated you can select an element with your mouse and click on it to open up the editor.
5. Do changes as you wish and click 'Save Changes' to save your newly created CSS code. To find out more please read our documentation by going to 'Probuilder' in the admin section.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

What happens if I destroyed some part of my website?

If you did some changes and now your website looks like a mess you can simply click on 'All Probuilds' on the right side of your screen (in front end). This will give you an overview over all changes you have made. You can then simply edit a change by clicking on it or click on the trash icon to completely delete the styling for that element.

Will Probuilder work with my theme?

We have tested Probuilder on several WordPress installs with several different themes and it did work for all of them. However since Probuilder is still very young we can not guarantee the functionality in every theme. If you experience problems please write us: probuilder@lingulo.com

I added a value in the editor but nothing happens on my website, why?

This sounds like another CSS rule is more specific and therefore stronger than the one you just created. You can try to add '!important' just after the value you entered. In the future we will take care of this problem by determining whether a rule you added applies or not and if not add the '!important' automatically.

Probuilder is not working as expected or looks messed up, what can I do?

Please send us a link to your site or a screenshot so we can investigate what the problem might be. Also please make sure to update to the latest WordPress version and to use a modern browser. Please don't use Internet Explorer ;)

== Screenshots ==

1. The simple Probuilder editor, just add a value and the change will be visible to you on your page immediately
2. Using the Pro version of Probuilder you have great features like Autoprefixing, media queries and keyframes.
3. See the generated CSS code and add custom code if you like.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Upgrade to Probuilder Pro to get great new features: Using Autoprefixer Probuilder makes sure your CSS code works in every browser. The media query functionality lets you create custom breakpoints and then define certain style changes to only occur on specific screen widths. Many more CSS properties can be used and there is a way to make specific style changes only occur on the current page instead of the whole website.
